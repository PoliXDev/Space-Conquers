Space Conquers: Arcade Game Developed in Python
Space Conquers is an arcade game developed in Python as part of the coursework at ConquerBlocks Academy. The game leverages the Pygame library, which provides essential functionalities for graphics, sound, and event control. Additionally, it uses several other Python libraries:

-sys for system management,
-random for random elements,
-time for time control,
-json for score storage,
-datetime for recording game session timestamps,
-math for visual effect calculations.

The gameplay revolves around a player-controlled spaceship that must face waves of enemies across various levels. Key mechanics include shooting, a lives system, temporary invulnerability, particle effects for explosions, high scores, and progressively increasing difficulty. The interface features a main menu with options to play, view instructions, and check scores. The game experience is enhanced with modern visual effects such as neon glows, particle explosions, and a space-themed soundtrack.
